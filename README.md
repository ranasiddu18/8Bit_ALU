# 8Bit_ALU
Designed and verified a synthesizable 8-bit Signed ALU with opcodes using Verilog HDL, capable of performing 27 distinct operations including arithmetic, bitwise logic, shifting, and comparison. The design features a 16-bit output architecture to preserve precision during multiplication and arithmetic shifts, preventing data loss.
